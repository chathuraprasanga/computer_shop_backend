# Autoregressive Language Model

This code implements an autoregressive language model that has been fine-tuned with instruction-tuning and RLHF. The model is able to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

## Installation

To install the model, you will need to have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can then install the model using the following command:

```
pip install autoregressive-language-model
```

## Usage

Once the model is installed, you can use it to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way. To do this, you will need to create a new instance of the model. You can do this using the following code:

```
from autoregressive_language_model import AutoregressiveLanguageModel

model = AutoregressiveLanguageModel()
```

Once you have created an instance of the model, you can use it to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way. To do this, you will need to call the `generate` method. The `generate` method takes a single argument, which is the text that you want the model to generate. The model will then generate text that is similar to the text that you provided.

For example, the following code will generate a sentence of text:

```
model.generate("The cat sat on the mat.")
```

The output of the above code will be a sentence of text that is similar to the sentence that was provided.
